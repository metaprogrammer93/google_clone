# google-results 
This is my attempt at reproducing the google results page for the search "build a webpage". Once again, the goal was to practice my html and css markup and acessability skills, so none of the links or drop down menus function and no javascript was used to create effects.

## What I learned (beyond what was learned in previous projects)

* How to use negative margins to both increase the size of elements and decrease the space between adjacent elements
* How padding and negative margins are able to alter the size and shape of borders
* How absolutely positioned elements are dependant on relatively positioned elements as well as how these absolutely positioned elements can be positioned to (optionally) overlap other elements
* How to use the overflow css element to cut off images or allow big images to fully display
* How to use the before pseudo element to create "icons"
* How to apply slightly darkened backgrounds to images in order to darken the image
* How to use the background-position css element on big images to decide which parts of the image to include and exclude
* How to use line-height to match the height of text elements with nontext elements in a line
* How to adjust where the hover pseudo class is applied to alter which elements activate the hover condition
* How to adjust the vertical position of elements in a table
* How to specify all immediate child elements of an element
* How to use the not css modifier
* How to apply floats to elements and text-align to move around text elements 
* How to center elements using absolute positioning and top/bottom/left/right css specifiers
* How to alter the spacing of lists
